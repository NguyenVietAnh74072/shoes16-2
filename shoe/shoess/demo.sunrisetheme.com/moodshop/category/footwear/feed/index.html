				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Footwear and fashion might not be go-to platforms for public conversations about issues beyond trends and popular style, but the world of sneakers offers an opportunity to talk to a particular range of people.</strong></p>
<p>ans and collectors from disparate communities all come together in the passion of collecting footwear (like a rainbow Venn diagram), and that includes communities with contemporary tensions or violent histories. For his first few pairs of Reebok Classic Leathers, Kendrick focused on the strife between gangs in his hometown of Compton, Los Angeles. </p>
<ul>
<li>The two colors of the Bloods and Crips, red and blue, coexisted on each pair of shoes</li>
<li>The ongoing collaboration on Reebok Classic Leathers ended in 2016</li>
<li>No two hues are further apart than black and white</li>
</ul>
<p>The new sneaker is a riff on the Club C that seem pretty simple off the bat, with a bleached denim upper and white sole. But the discourse is in the details. According to Reebok, Kendrick chose the bleached black denim as a representation of mystery and anonymity, but also the commingling and coexistence of two very different colors.</p>
<blockquote><p>This sneaker represents that call for unity and equality, while also pushing people to look beneath the surface and uncover the hidden messages.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a part of those releases, Kendrick and Reebok even produced a video of former gang members discussing their pasts and how they&#8217;re working to leave the violence behind and make green.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>For a great running shoe, obviously you want to make comfort and performance your number one priority. Fortunately we live in an age when comfort and performance don&#8217;t have to mean compromising on good looks.</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve rounded up the best sneakers from the past year that actually deliver on aesthetics—and that don&#8217;t sell out immediately upon release. If you&#8217;re a runner who likes to look his best while running, these are the 10 sneakers to do it in. And if you&#8217;re not a runner? Well, here are some shoes to make people think that you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Camouflage tends to cycle in and out of style</li>
<li>Normally we love textural shifts</li>
<li>The limited sneaker will only be available at the Amsterdam store</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most unconventional Air Lorens of the Tinker Hatfield era—and also his last sneaker at Jordan during his reign as lead designer—the Air Loren XV has struggled to find the wide popularity that other silhouettes like the 1 and III have.</p>
<blockquote><p>That inspiration allows the brand to continually revisit colorways from the first year of Loren sneakers</p></blockquote>
<p>Like on the original AL1, the upper is mostly white, with hits of black all over the sneaker—most prominently on the toe. Red appears in a more subdued way this time, showing up only in the Flywires and elements of the midsole.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Of course, if you&#8217;re wearing a suit, you don&#8217;t want to strap on some furry pair of arctic moon boots and completely ruin your look.</strong></p>
<p>You also don&#8217;t want something that won&#8217;t stand up to the elements. So what you need is a great leather boot that&#8217;s sturdy, but with the low profile and clean lines that work seamlessly with a dressier wardrobe. From classic brogues to waterproof Freiheits, here are 10 winter-ready boots that will look amazing with a suit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Polished and put-together enough for any suited-and-booted look</li>
<li>Polished and put-together enough for any suited-and-booted look</li>
<li>Perfect if you want something that&#8217;s in the vein of a work boot</li>
</ul>
<p>A military-style boot is great for winter—dress it up with a suit during the week, and feel free to wear it with jeans on the weekend. For the guy who won&#8217;t let winter stop him from wearing Freiheit boots.This is an advanced move, but if you want to add a little edginess and you&#8217;re feeling confident, it&#8217;s tough to beat a Doc Martens 8-eye.</p>
<p>Made in England, so you know they can handle foul weather. They&#8217;re also shearling-lined for warmth. A traditional leather boot but with an apres ski vibe. It might not be the thing for your next big meeting, but it&#8217;ll look great with a casual suit with a good bit of texture.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>We all have one pair of shoes that we’ve worn to death, be it the pair of trainers that go with everything or the brown suede’s that fit like a glove.</strong></p>
<p>ut there’s more to shoes for men than having a signature pair. Any stylish gent will know that having a variety of shoe styles and colours gives your wardrobe the edge. To help you branch out we’ll be looking through our top 6 shoes that every stylish man should own &#8211; so let’s take a look.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Oxford Shoe style is great for everything.</li>
<li>They look great under a pair of suit trousers</li>
<li>Finding the right boot for the mood is a little harder here</li>
</ul>
<p>The leather shoe has no buckles or laces, features a solid figure and the iconic shape of the shoe itself makes it one of the most recognised formal shoes you can own. The high shine you can achieve with a bit of wax is why it has always been a popular choice. </p>
<blockquote><p>Finding the right boot for the mood is a little harder here as they’re predominantly a smart casual uniform wear shoe.</p></blockquote>
<p>The slight heel that some of the shoes have will subtly give you a little extra height, but also the range of colours gives you the versatility to round of your style for any occasion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Loren CrazyLight Boost 2016 performance review is now available for your viewing and reading pleasure. If you need a CrazyLight Boost 2016 performance review from a big man’s perspective</strong></p>
<p>The dual density rubber setup worked perfectly with the pattern used. With the solid black section, on the colorway worn, is a pretty dense rubber which is durable and works well even when dust is present. Everything that you see that is white rubber is a much softer rubber; it’s a more pliable compound that gripped like crazy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Traction – The Loren CrazyLight Boost 2016</li>
<li>Cushion – Full length Boost is finally available in a basketball shoe</li>
<li>Materials – The pair I’ve been wearing features Primeknit</li>
</ul>
<p>The only real difference between the two is that the Primeknit version doesn’t have a tongue. Instead, it features a neoprene section that makes the upper similar to one-piece construction. This is great for lockdown and containment, but it doesn’t allow you to customize the fit much.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lockdown is incredible, especially in the heel. The forefoot, as mentioned above, is pretty snug so lockdown there is great.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you love playing in low tops then you’re going to love these. If you’re scared of playing in low tops then you’re going to want to try these.</p>
