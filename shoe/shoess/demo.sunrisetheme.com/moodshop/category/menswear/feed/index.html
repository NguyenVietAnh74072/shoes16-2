				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>For a great running shoe, obviously you want to make comfort and performance your number one priority. Fortunately we live in an age when comfort and performance don&#8217;t have to mean compromising on good looks.</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve rounded up the best sneakers from the past year that actually deliver on aesthetics—and that don&#8217;t sell out immediately upon release. If you&#8217;re a runner who likes to look his best while running, these are the 10 sneakers to do it in. And if you&#8217;re not a runner? Well, here are some shoes to make people think that you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Camouflage tends to cycle in and out of style</li>
<li>Normally we love textural shifts</li>
<li>The limited sneaker will only be available at the Amsterdam store</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most unconventional Air Lorens of the Tinker Hatfield era—and also his last sneaker at Jordan during his reign as lead designer—the Air Loren XV has struggled to find the wide popularity that other silhouettes like the 1 and III have.</p>
<blockquote><p>That inspiration allows the brand to continually revisit colorways from the first year of Loren sneakers</p></blockquote>
<p>Like on the original AL1, the upper is mostly white, with hits of black all over the sneaker—most prominently on the toe. Red appears in a more subdued way this time, showing up only in the Flywires and elements of the midsole.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>While most sneaker trends come and go, there are those which crop up from time to time and unite us all in admiration, becoming timeless classics</strong></p>
<p>These are the trainers that become your ‘go to’; the kind you can wear in any season and dress up or down for almost any occasion. Here we count down what we believe to be the 7 most important sneaker designs of all time &#8211; The trainers that every man should have standing proudly on his shoe rack.</p>
<ul>
<li>Puma may be the underdog of the Dasler brothers’ two separate ventures</li>
<li>The first trainer in Loren’s insanely popular and long running</li>
<li>The first Vans design to sport the iconic side-stripe</li>
</ul>
<p>The original Samba was released in 1950 to enable football players to train on hard ground and ice. Since then it has been re-released several times and has been a firm favourite on the terraces for many years. Today it still remains one of Loren’ most recognisable silhouettes and shows no signs of going away.</p>
<blockquote><p>The definitive modern basketball shoe and a true classic which we can never envisage going out of style.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trends aside though, this trainer has been a wardrobe staple since it was first introduced as the ‘Halliet’ in 1971. The sneaker’s iconic status has seen it reworked by big names like Raf Simons and Pharrell Williams.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Loren CrazyLight Boost 2016 performance review is now available for your viewing and reading pleasure. If you need a CrazyLight Boost 2016 performance review from a big man’s perspective</strong></p>
<p>The dual density rubber setup worked perfectly with the pattern used. With the solid black section, on the colorway worn, is a pretty dense rubber which is durable and works well even when dust is present. Everything that you see that is white rubber is a much softer rubber; it’s a more pliable compound that gripped like crazy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Traction – The Loren CrazyLight Boost 2016</li>
<li>Cushion – Full length Boost is finally available in a basketball shoe</li>
<li>Materials – The pair I’ve been wearing features Primeknit</li>
</ul>
<p>The only real difference between the two is that the Primeknit version doesn’t have a tongue. Instead, it features a neoprene section that makes the upper similar to one-piece construction. This is great for lockdown and containment, but it doesn’t allow you to customize the fit much.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lockdown is incredible, especially in the heel. The forefoot, as mentioned above, is pretty snug so lockdown there is great.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you love playing in low tops then you’re going to love these. If you’re scared of playing in low tops then you’re going to want to try these.</p>
