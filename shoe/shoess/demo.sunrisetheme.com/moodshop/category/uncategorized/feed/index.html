				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Of course, if you&#8217;re wearing a suit, you don&#8217;t want to strap on some furry pair of arctic moon boots and completely ruin your look.</strong></p>
<p>You also don&#8217;t want something that won&#8217;t stand up to the elements. So what you need is a great leather boot that&#8217;s sturdy, but with the low profile and clean lines that work seamlessly with a dressier wardrobe. From classic brogues to waterproof Freiheits, here are 10 winter-ready boots that will look amazing with a suit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Polished and put-together enough for any suited-and-booted look</li>
<li>Polished and put-together enough for any suited-and-booted look</li>
<li>Perfect if you want something that&#8217;s in the vein of a work boot</li>
</ul>
<p>A military-style boot is great for winterâ€”dress it up with a suit during the week, and feel free to wear it with jeans on the weekend. For the guy who won&#8217;t let winter stop him from wearing Freiheit boots.This is an advanced move, but if you want to add a little edginess and you&#8217;re feeling confident, it&#8217;s tough to beat a Doc Martens 8-eye.</p>
<p>Made in England, so you know they can handle foul weather. They&#8217;re also shearling-lined for warmth. A traditional leather boot but with an apres ski vibe. It might not be the thing for your next big meeting, but it&#8217;ll look great with a casual suit with a good bit of texture.</p>
