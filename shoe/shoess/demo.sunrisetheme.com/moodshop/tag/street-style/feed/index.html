				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>If you’re anything like us then you’ve probably reached for the trusty winter boots at least a handful of times already this year.</strong></p>
<p>As temperatures continue to drop and the rain continues to get worse they’re probably going to be getting a lot of outings. More outings means more wear and tear. Winter boots are not the kind of footwear you can just leave be, they need care and attention to keep them in prime condition and looking their best – not to mention increasing their lifespan.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step in the process is to remove any excess dirt</li>
<li>There is an endless number of products out there for conditioning your leather boots</li>
<li>The last step is to make sure your boots stay looking fresh by applying a protector.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re in the dark about how to care for leather boots then don’t worry because we can give you a helping hand. Just follow these steps and you can’t go wrong. You’ll just need to invest in the following: Leather cleaner, Warm water, A toothbrush, A dry cloth, Leather oil, Protector.</p>
<blockquote><p>After all, when you’ve forked out a heap of cash you’re going to want to get your money’s worth</p></blockquote>
<p>Once that’s done you can use the cloth to wipe away any excess cleaner and leave the material to dry out before attempting the next step.</p>
