				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Footwear refers to garments worn on the feet, which originally serves to purpose of protection against adversities of the environment, usually regarding ground textures and temperature.</strong></p>
<p>ans and collectors from disparate communities all come together in the passion of collecting footwear (like a rainbow Venn diagram), and that includes communities with contemporary tensions or violent histories. For his first few pairs of Reebok Classic Leathers, Kendrick focused on the strife between gangs in his hometown of Compton, Los Angeles. </p>
<ul>
<li>The two colors of the Bloods and Crips, red and blue, coexisted on each pair of shoes</li>
<li>The ongoing collaboration on Reebok Classic Leathers ended in 2016</li>
<li>No two hues are further apart than black and white</li>
</ul>
<p>The new sneaker is a riff on the Club C that seem pretty simple off the bat, with a bleached denim upper and white sole. But the discourse is in the details. According to Reebok, Kendrick chose the bleached black denim as a representation of mystery and anonymity, but also the commingling and coexistence of two very different colors.</p>
<blockquote><p>This sneaker represents that call for unity and equality, while also pushing people to look beneath the surface and uncover the hidden messages.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a part of those releases, Kendrick and Reebok even produced a video of former gang members discussing their pasts and how they&#8217;re working to leave the violence behind and make green.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Loren CrazyLight Boost 2016 performance review is now available for your viewing and reading pleasure. If you need a CrazyLight Boost 2016 performance review from a big man’s perspective</strong></p>
<p>The dual density rubber setup worked perfectly with the pattern used. With the solid black section, on the colorway worn, is a pretty dense rubber which is durable and works well even when dust is present. Everything that you see that is white rubber is a much softer rubber; it’s a more pliable compound that gripped like crazy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Traction – The Loren CrazyLight Boost 2016</li>
<li>Cushion – Full length Boost is finally available in a basketball shoe</li>
<li>Materials – The pair I’ve been wearing features Primeknit</li>
</ul>
<p>The only real difference between the two is that the Primeknit version doesn’t have a tongue. Instead, it features a neoprene section that makes the upper similar to one-piece construction. This is great for lockdown and containment, but it doesn’t allow you to customize the fit much.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lockdown is incredible, especially in the heel. The forefoot, as mentioned above, is pretty snug so lockdown there is great.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you love playing in low tops then you’re going to love these. If you’re scared of playing in low tops then you’re going to want to try these.</p>
