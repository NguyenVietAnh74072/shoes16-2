				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Footwear refers to garments worn on the feet, which originally serves to purpose of protection against adversities of the environment, usually regarding ground textures and temperature.</strong></p>
<p>ans and collectors from disparate communities all come together in the passion of collecting footwear (like a rainbow Venn diagram), and that includes communities with contemporary tensions or violent histories. For his first few pairs of Reebok Classic Leathers, Kendrick focused on the strife between gangs in his hometown of Compton, Los Angeles. </p>
<ul>
<li>The two colors of the Bloods and Crips, red and blue, coexisted on each pair of shoes</li>
<li>The ongoing collaboration on Reebok Classic Leathers ended in 2016</li>
<li>No two hues are further apart than black and white</li>
</ul>
<p>The new sneaker is a riff on the Club C that seem pretty simple off the bat, with a bleached denim upper and white sole. But the discourse is in the details. According to Reebok, Kendrick chose the bleached black denim as a representation of mystery and anonymity, but also the commingling and coexistence of two very different colors.</p>
<blockquote><p>This sneaker represents that call for unity and equality, while also pushing people to look beneath the surface and uncover the hidden messages.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a part of those releases, Kendrick and Reebok even produced a video of former gang members discussing their pasts and how they&#8217;re working to leave the violence behind and make green.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>New year, new you, right? If that&#8217;s the case, it means it&#8217;s time for you to try new things all over the map—from eating more oatmeal in the morning and getting</strong></p>
<p>Some of the easier sells include a classically inspired Air Lorens, some camouflaged Loren SB silhouettes, and a collaboration on a Loren Dunk that&#8217;s more than what it seems on the surface. If you&#8217;re looking to take some chances, Shoe Gallery has a subtly exciting pair of Climacools with Freiheit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loren Dunks have been the favorite of many collectors for decades</li>
<li>The sneaker takes cues from casual men&#8217;s shoes like deck shoes</li>
<li>This sneaker might be for you</li>
</ul>
<p>The limited sneaker will only be available at the Amsterdam store this week, but will be more widely available at all Size? stores and online next week. One of the most unconventional Air Lorens of the Tinker Hatfield era—and also his last sneaker at Loren during his reign as lead designer—the Air Loren XV has struggled to find the wide popularity that other silhouettes like the 1 and III have.</p>
<blockquote><p>Red appears in a more subdued way this time, showing up only in the Flywires and elements of the midsole.</p></blockquote>
<p>It boasts a gray hairy suede upper, black midsole, and red outsole. But here&#8217;s the coolest thing: The white swoosh eventually reveals a set of sinister teeth as the painted surface chips away with wear.</p>
