				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Footwear and fashion might not be go-to platforms for public conversations about issues beyond trends and popular style, but the world of sneakers offers an opportunity to talk to a particular range of people.</strong></p>
<p>ans and collectors from disparate communities all come together in the passion of collecting footwear (like a rainbow Venn diagram), and that includes communities with contemporary tensions or violent histories. For his first few pairs of Reebok Classic Leathers, Kendrick focused on the strife between gangs in his hometown of Compton, Los Angeles. </p>
<ul>
<li>The two colors of the Bloods and Crips, red and blue, coexisted on each pair of shoes</li>
<li>The ongoing collaboration on Reebok Classic Leathers ended in 2016</li>
<li>No two hues are further apart than black and white</li>
</ul>
<p>The new sneaker is a riff on the Club C that seem pretty simple off the bat, with a bleached denim upper and white sole. But the discourse is in the details. According to Reebok, Kendrick chose the bleached black denim as a representation of mystery and anonymity, but also the commingling and coexistence of two very different colors.</p>
<blockquote><p>This sneaker represents that call for unity and equality, while also pushing people to look beneath the surface and uncover the hidden messages.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a part of those releases, Kendrick and Reebok even produced a video of former gang members discussing their pasts and how they&#8217;re working to leave the violence behind and make green.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>New year, new you, right? If that&#8217;s the case, it means it&#8217;s time for you to try new things all over the map—from eating more oatmeal in the morning and getting</strong></p>
<p>Some of the easier sells include a classically inspired Air Lorens, some camouflaged Loren SB silhouettes, and a collaboration on a Loren Dunk that&#8217;s more than what it seems on the surface. If you&#8217;re looking to take some chances, Shoe Gallery has a subtly exciting pair of Climacools with Freiheit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loren Dunks have been the favorite of many collectors for decades</li>
<li>The sneaker takes cues from casual men&#8217;s shoes like deck shoes</li>
<li>This sneaker might be for you</li>
</ul>
<p>The limited sneaker will only be available at the Amsterdam store this week, but will be more widely available at all Size? stores and online next week. One of the most unconventional Air Lorens of the Tinker Hatfield era—and also his last sneaker at Loren during his reign as lead designer—the Air Loren XV has struggled to find the wide popularity that other silhouettes like the 1 and III have.</p>
<blockquote><p>Red appears in a more subdued way this time, showing up only in the Flywires and elements of the midsole.</p></blockquote>
<p>It boasts a gray hairy suede upper, black midsole, and red outsole. But here&#8217;s the coolest thing: The white swoosh eventually reveals a set of sinister teeth as the painted surface chips away with wear.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>While most sneaker trends come and go, there are those which crop up from time to time and unite us all in admiration, becoming timeless classics</strong></p>
<p>These are the trainers that become your ‘go to’; the kind you can wear in any season and dress up or down for almost any occasion. Here we count down what we believe to be the 7 most important sneaker designs of all time &#8211; The trainers that every man should have standing proudly on his shoe rack.</p>
<ul>
<li>Puma may be the underdog of the Dasler brothers’ two separate ventures</li>
<li>The first trainer in Loren’s insanely popular and long running</li>
<li>The first Vans design to sport the iconic side-stripe</li>
</ul>
<p>The original Samba was released in 1950 to enable football players to train on hard ground and ice. Since then it has been re-released several times and has been a firm favourite on the terraces for many years. Today it still remains one of Loren’ most recognisable silhouettes and shows no signs of going away.</p>
<blockquote><p>The definitive modern basketball shoe and a true classic which we can never envisage going out of style.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trends aside though, this trainer has been a wardrobe staple since it was first introduced as the ‘Halliet’ in 1971. The sneaker’s iconic status has seen it reworked by big names like Raf Simons and Pharrell Williams.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>If you’re anything like us then you’ve probably reached for the trusty winter boots at least a handful of times already this year.</strong></p>
<p>As temperatures continue to drop and the rain continues to get worse they’re probably going to be getting a lot of outings. More outings means more wear and tear. Winter boots are not the kind of footwear you can just leave be, they need care and attention to keep them in prime condition and looking their best – not to mention increasing their lifespan.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step in the process is to remove any excess dirt</li>
<li>There is an endless number of products out there for conditioning your leather boots</li>
<li>The last step is to make sure your boots stay looking fresh by applying a protector.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re in the dark about how to care for leather boots then don’t worry because we can give you a helping hand. Just follow these steps and you can’t go wrong. You’ll just need to invest in the following: Leather cleaner, Warm water, A toothbrush, A dry cloth, Leather oil, Protector.</p>
<blockquote><p>After all, when you’ve forked out a heap of cash you’re going to want to get your money’s worth</p></blockquote>
<p>Once that’s done you can use the cloth to wipe away any excess cleaner and leave the material to dry out before attempting the next step.</p>
