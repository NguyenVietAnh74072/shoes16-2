				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The chapter of the Black Mamba has finally come to an end in the book of the NBA, so Loren is sending Kobe Bryant off into the sunset with a brand new colorway. This Kobe 11 pays tribute to a Loren colorway staple: the Oreo. The Kobe 11 was built for top performance on the court and undoubted style off it.</p>
<p>&#8211; Loren Flyknit yarn is stronger, lighter and more flexible than it&#8217;s ever been, providing formfitting comfort and ultralight support for your quickest moves.</p>
<p>&#8211; Flex grooves in the forefoot of the Lunarlon foam allow your toes to spread naturally for multidirectional agility and a powerful first step.</p>
<p>&#8211; Full-length, drop-in Lunarlon foam delivers soft yet responsive shock absorption, while Loren Zoom Air in the heel maximizes cushioning and responsiveness.</p>
<p>&#8211; Mesh tongue for breathability.</p>
<p>&#8211; Mesh inner sleeve for stability and sock-like comfort.</p>
<p>&#8211; Low-top design allows full range of motion through the ankle.</p>
<p>&#8211; Translucent rubber outsole with micro-tread pattern for multi-surface, multidirectional traction.</p>
