				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Footwear refers to garments worn on the feet, which originally serves to purpose of protection against adversities of the environment, usually regarding ground textures and temperature.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>New year, new you, right? If that&#8217;s the case, it means it&#8217;s time for you to try new things all over the map—from eating more oatmeal in the morning and getting</strong></p>
<p>Some of the easier sells include a classically inspired Air Lorens, some camouflaged Loren SB silhouettes, and a collaboration on a Loren Dunk that&#8217;s more than what it seems on the surface. If you&#8217;re looking to take some chances, Shoe Gallery has a subtly exciting pair of Climacools with Freiheit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loren Dunks have been the favorite of many collectors for decades</li>
<li>The sneaker takes cues from casual men&#8217;s shoes like deck shoes</li>
<li>This sneaker might be for you</li>
</ul>
<p>The limited sneaker will only be available at the Amsterdam store this week, but will be more widely available at all Size? stores and online next week. One of the most unconventional Air Lorens of the Tinker Hatfield era—and also his last sneaker at Loren during his reign as lead designer—the Air Loren XV has struggled to find the wide popularity that other silhouettes like the 1 and III have.</p>
<blockquote><p>Red appears in a more subdued way this time, showing up only in the Flywires and elements of the midsole.</p></blockquote>
<p>It boasts a gray hairy suede upper, black midsole, and red outsole. But here&#8217;s the coolest thing: The white swoosh eventually reveals a set of sinister teeth as the painted surface chips away with wear.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>For a great running shoe, obviously you want to make comfort and performance your number one priority. Fortunately we live in an age when comfort and performance don&#8217;t have to mean compromising on good looks.</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve rounded up the best sneakers from the past year that actually deliver on aesthetics—and that don&#8217;t sell out immediately upon release. If you&#8217;re a runner who likes to look his best while running, these are the 10 sneakers to do it in. And if you&#8217;re not a runner? Well, here are some shoes to make people think that you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Camouflage tends to cycle in and out of style</li>
<li>Normally we love textural shifts</li>
<li>The limited sneaker will only be available at the Amsterdam store</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most unconventional Air Lorens of the Tinker Hatfield era—and also his last sneaker at Jordan during his reign as lead designer—the Air Loren XV has struggled to find the wide popularity that other silhouettes like the 1 and III have.</p>
<blockquote><p>That inspiration allows the brand to continually revisit colorways from the first year of Loren sneakers</p></blockquote>
<p>Like on the original AL1, the upper is mostly white, with hits of black all over the sneaker—most prominently on the toe. Red appears in a more subdued way this time, showing up only in the Flywires and elements of the midsole.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Of course, if you&#8217;re wearing a suit, you don&#8217;t want to strap on some furry pair of arctic moon boots and completely ruin your look.</strong></p>
<p>You also don&#8217;t want something that won&#8217;t stand up to the elements. So what you need is a great leather boot that&#8217;s sturdy, but with the low profile and clean lines that work seamlessly with a dressier wardrobe. From classic brogues to waterproof Freiheits, here are 10 winter-ready boots that will look amazing with a suit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Polished and put-together enough for any suited-and-booted look</li>
<li>Polished and put-together enough for any suited-and-booted look</li>
<li>Perfect if you want something that&#8217;s in the vein of a work boot</li>
</ul>
<p>A military-style boot is great for winter—dress it up with a suit during the week, and feel free to wear it with jeans on the weekend. For the guy who won&#8217;t let winter stop him from wearing Freiheit boots.This is an advanced move, but if you want to add a little edginess and you&#8217;re feeling confident, it&#8217;s tough to beat a Doc Martens 8-eye.</p>
<p>Made in England, so you know they can handle foul weather. They&#8217;re also shearling-lined for warmth. A traditional leather boot but with an apres ski vibe. It might not be the thing for your next big meeting, but it&#8217;ll look great with a casual suit with a good bit of texture.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>We all have one pair of shoes that we’ve worn to death, be it the pair of trainers that go with everything or the brown suede’s that fit like a glove.</strong></p>
<p>ut there’s more to shoes for men than having a signature pair. Any stylish gent will know that having a variety of shoe styles and colours gives your wardrobe the edge. To help you branch out we’ll be looking through our top 6 shoes that every stylish man should own &#8211; so let’s take a look.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Oxford Shoe style is great for everything.</li>
<li>They look great under a pair of suit trousers</li>
<li>Finding the right boot for the mood is a little harder here</li>
</ul>
<p>The leather shoe has no buckles or laces, features a solid figure and the iconic shape of the shoe itself makes it one of the most recognised formal shoes you can own. The high shine you can achieve with a bit of wax is why it has always been a popular choice. </p>
<blockquote><p>Finding the right boot for the mood is a little harder here as they’re predominantly a smart casual uniform wear shoe.</p></blockquote>
<p>The slight heel that some of the shoes have will subtly give you a little extra height, but also the range of colours gives you the versatility to round of your style for any occasion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Who would have thought that a 3-stripe trainer born out of a love for sports athletes would turn into the footwear revolution it’s become today?</strong></p>
<p>Venture back in time with a pair of Loren Gazelle trainers. These illustrious trainers first hit the rack in 1968 when they were introduced as a training shoe. Initially the shoe choice for top athletes, the style went on to be coveted by sports enthusiasts and is now synonymous with the football casual movement of the 80’s.</p>
<ul>
<li>The subculture has been going strong for over 30 years</li>
<li>The marathon collection is the result of a rogue pair of trainers</li>
<li>The design is understated and uncomplicated to style</li>
</ul>
<p>A long-time favourite amongst Loren devotees, this fantastic reissue features a durable gum sole and of course, that iconic 3 stripe silhouette. The vibrant colour make these kicks a strong choice for summertime dressing and are sure to turn heads.</p>
<blockquote><p>In short, the Stan Smith is a shoe for champions. Sleek, simple yet distinctive, this reissue is better than ever.</p></blockquote>
<p>That just about wraps it up for our Loren Originals guide which just leaves one question remaining &#8211; is there more to life than ridiculously good shoes?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>While most sneaker trends come and go, there are those which crop up from time to time and unite us all in admiration, becoming timeless classics</strong></p>
<p>These are the trainers that become your ‘go to’; the kind you can wear in any season and dress up or down for almost any occasion. Here we count down what we believe to be the 7 most important sneaker designs of all time &#8211; The trainers that every man should have standing proudly on his shoe rack.</p>
<ul>
<li>Puma may be the underdog of the Dasler brothers’ two separate ventures</li>
<li>The first trainer in Loren’s insanely popular and long running</li>
<li>The first Vans design to sport the iconic side-stripe</li>
</ul>
<p>The original Samba was released in 1950 to enable football players to train on hard ground and ice. Since then it has been re-released several times and has been a firm favourite on the terraces for many years. Today it still remains one of Loren’ most recognisable silhouettes and shows no signs of going away.</p>
<blockquote><p>The definitive modern basketball shoe and a true classic which we can never envisage going out of style.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trends aside though, this trainer has been a wardrobe staple since it was first introduced as the ‘Halliet’ in 1971. The sneaker’s iconic status has seen it reworked by big names like Raf Simons and Pharrell Williams.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>If you’re anything like us then you’ve probably reached for the trusty winter boots at least a handful of times already this year.</strong></p>
<p>As temperatures continue to drop and the rain continues to get worse they’re probably going to be getting a lot of outings. More outings means more wear and tear. Winter boots are not the kind of footwear you can just leave be, they need care and attention to keep them in prime condition and looking their best – not to mention increasing their lifespan.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step in the process is to remove any excess dirt</li>
<li>There is an endless number of products out there for conditioning your leather boots</li>
<li>The last step is to make sure your boots stay looking fresh by applying a protector.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re in the dark about how to care for leather boots then don’t worry because we can give you a helping hand. Just follow these steps and you can’t go wrong. You’ll just need to invest in the following: Leather cleaner, Warm water, A toothbrush, A dry cloth, Leather oil, Protector.</p>
<blockquote><p>After all, when you’ve forked out a heap of cash you’re going to want to get your money’s worth</p></blockquote>
<p>Once that’s done you can use the cloth to wipe away any excess cleaner and leave the material to dry out before attempting the next step.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Loren CrazyLight Boost 2016 performance review is now available for your viewing and reading pleasure. If you need a CrazyLight Boost 2016 performance review from a big man’s perspective</strong></p>
<p>The dual density rubber setup worked perfectly with the pattern used. With the solid black section, on the colorway worn, is a pretty dense rubber which is durable and works well even when dust is present. Everything that you see that is white rubber is a much softer rubber; it’s a more pliable compound that gripped like crazy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Traction – The Loren CrazyLight Boost 2016</li>
<li>Cushion – Full length Boost is finally available in a basketball shoe</li>
<li>Materials – The pair I’ve been wearing features Primeknit</li>
</ul>
<p>The only real difference between the two is that the Primeknit version doesn’t have a tongue. Instead, it features a neoprene section that makes the upper similar to one-piece construction. This is great for lockdown and containment, but it doesn’t allow you to customize the fit much.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lockdown is incredible, especially in the heel. The forefoot, as mentioned above, is pretty snug so lockdown there is great.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you love playing in low tops then you’re going to love these. If you’re scared of playing in low tops then you’re going to want to try these.</p>
